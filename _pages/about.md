I am now an assistant professor (tenure-track) at [School of Mathematical Sciences, Tongji University](https://math.tongji.edu.cn) (since July 2021). 

Before that, I was a postdoc at [Institute of Applied Mathematics, AMSS, CAS](http://amt.amss.cas.cn), mentored by Professor [Zhi-Ming Ma](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/8eb59241e2e74d828fb84eec0efadba5/myHomePage.html) (2019.6-2021.6).

I obtained my Ph.D in [School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn), under the supervision of Professor [Jiangang Ying](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/fa/5d/c30607a326237/page.htm) in June, 2019. 

My research interest is on Markov processes and Dirichlet forms, especially the interface of probability and analysis.
